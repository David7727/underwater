**Underwater Treasure Hunt**

This is a simple text-based diving game.
You are a diver searching for oysters and pearls.

Oysters are worth 1 point.
Pearls are worth 5 points.
The objective is to collect 20 points or more before danger strikes.

**Beware!**

Sharks lurk in the water! If you encounter a shark, your game ends immediately.
Use the look command for safe exploration and avoid reckless moves.
Octopi are unpredictable: they may help or hinder you, but encountering them never ends the game.
